# 🚀 MVP Blueprint 

## 1. Remote Talent Discovery
- **Web App** (React.js, offline-first, syncs when online).  
- Athletes upload short video clips of drills (running, push-ups, squats, sprints).  
- **AI models** (MediaPipe + TensorFlow Lite + OpenCV) analyze:  
  - Posture (joint detection, alignment)  
  - Speed (frame-by-frame motion analysis)  
  - Stamina (repetition consistency)  
  - Reaction time (movement delay tracking)  
- **Standardized fitness scoring system** ensures fair comparisons across regions.  

---

## 2. Performance Tracking
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB  

Tracks & logs:  
- Speed improvements  
- Endurance trends  
- Injury risk detection (bad posture, overtraining)  
- Reports auto-generated with **progress charts & goals**  

---

## 3. Dual Dashboards
### 🏃 Athlete Dashboard (React.js + Chart.js/Recharts)
- Tracks fitness history, badges, and progress  
- Sets personal training goals  
- Compares ranking with peers  

### 🧑‍🏫 Coach Dashboard (React.js + Chart.js/Recharts)
- Profiles of athletes with performance analytics  
- Predictive injury alerts using **PyTorch models**  
- Benchmarks at district/state/national levels  

---

## 4. AI/ML Features
- **Cheat Detection** → PyTorch + OpenCV to spot duplicate or manipulated videos  
- **Predictive Analytics** → PyTorch forecasts athlete growth & career trajectory  
- **Personalized Training Plans** → AI adapts recommendations based on tracked performance  

---

## 5. Inclusivity & Engagement
- **Gamification** → badges, leaderboards, streak challenges  
- **Community Features** → athletes connect, share milestones  
- **Multi-language Support** → Hindi, Telugu, Bengali, tribal languages  
- **Data Security** → encrypted MongoDB storage, consent-driven sharing  

---

## 🛠️ Final Tech Stack (Mapped to MVP)
- **Frontend**: React.js (web dashboards, offline-first support)  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (API, video handling, ML integration)  
- **Database**: MongoDB (athlete profiles, performance history, video metadata)  
- **AI Models**:  
  - MediaPipe + TensorFlow Lite → real-time pose estimation  
  - OpenCV → preprocessing, motion tracking  
  - PyTorch → cheat detection, predictive analytics, personalized plans  
- **Visualization**: Chart.js / Recharts (progress & analytics dashboards)  
- **Hosting/Deployment**: Render (backend + frontend deployment)  

---

## 🎯 Demo Flow (Hackathon Presentation)
1. Athlete records a **30-sec video** → uploads via React.js web app.  
2. **Node.js backend** processes video → OpenCV extracts frames → MediaPipe analyzes posture.  
3. **TensorFlow Lite** provides real-time form & rep feedback.  
4. **PyTorch model** flags risks & predicts long-term growth.  
5. Data stored in **MongoDB** → dashboards update with charts & history.  
6. Athlete earns **badges** → Coaches get **performance alerts**.

## 🌍 Impact Highlights
- **Smartphone-first, low infrastructure needed** → true rural accessibility  
- **AI democratizes talent discovery** → no bias, scalable nationwide  
- **Empowers athletes + coaches equally** with actionable insights  
- **Inclusive growth** → ensures tribal, rural, and girls’ participation  
- **Scalable to national level** → foundation for India’s **AI-driven sports ecosystem**
