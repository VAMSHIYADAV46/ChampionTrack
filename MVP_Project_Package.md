# üèÜ ChampionTrack ‚Äì MVP Project Package

---

## 1. MVP-Blueprint
**Contents:**
- **Project Name:** ChampionTrack  
- **Vision:** Democratize sports talent discovery and provide scientific, AI-powered athlete performance tracking for inclusive development.  
- **Tech Stack:**  
  - **Frontend:** React.js (with Context/Redux, Chart.js/Recharts for dashboards)  
  - **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js  
  - **Database:** MongoDB  
  - **ML/AI:** MediaPipe + TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch, OpenCV  
- **Roles:** Athlete, Coach  
- **Features:**  
  - Video uploads (drills)  
  - AI-powered performance analysis (posture, speed, stamina, reaction time)  
  - Coach dashboard (review & feedback)  
  - Athlete dashboard (progress tracking)  

---

## 2. Project-Requirements-Document (PRD)
**Functional requirements:**
- Athletes can register, log in, upload videos.  
- ML pipeline analyzes uploaded drills and returns metrics.  
- Coaches can view athletes, review performance, give feedback.  
- Dashboards: athlete progress charts, coach reports.  

**Non-functional requirements:**
- Scalability: 100+ simultaneous video uploads.  
- Latency: analysis within 30 seconds.  
- Security: JWT authentication, password hashing.  

**Success criteria:**
- Accurate detection of posture, repetition count, and timing.  
- Smooth dashboard experience.
